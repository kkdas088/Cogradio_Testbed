Basic  viablilty of Cognitive radio principle in GSM Bands
The wireless networks completely changed the landscape of communication, utilized the frequency spectrum
to achieve its needs. Today spectrum chunks are the biggest piece of real estate handled by corporate sectors
to provide suitable services to customer’s .In this competition spectrum allocation has been very static, unable
to adapt to the current pattern of consumer demands. This lead to creation of flexible protocols whose
implementation requires entire set of new smart nodes to be deployed in the network.
One of the prototype devices to hit the market is Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP) which is our basic
node for Cognitive Radio Test Bed. To come up with a suitable set up, where all protocols of Physical layer to
Networking layer can be seamlessly switched and instantly deployed with a relative ease requires a more
coherent approach from a software perspective. Influx of different types of software’s to cater various needs
of the Test Bed such as SQL for Database aspects of the project and Python to create a flow graph around all
functional blocks of the project requires curating all the steps so as to achieve a harmonious utilization of the
various aspects of these software packages.
This manual tries to be a basic handbook to start a journey into the world of Gnu Radio coupled with USRP to
suitably deploy a Test Bed demonstrating various basic principles of Cognitive Radio. The technical jargon has
been kept a bare minimum so as to focus on the “How’s” of the implementation rather than “Why’s” of the
project. A functional flow graph has been chosen to devour all the contents of the project and show all the
interdependencies between them. Also various basic commands of software packages are listed which are
frequently utilized to tune parameters of the functions and probe into various “on the run “aspects of the
device.
Lastly this manual is developed with assumptions about the users who has a programming background and
has an avid knowledge of the technical aspects of the wireless communication related to cognitive radio. The
manual is not comprehensive enough to encompass every aspect but few things to be added in near future
are fine tune settings for non LOS based setup and more abstract way of handling various pop up errors
during “On the run” of the test bed.
